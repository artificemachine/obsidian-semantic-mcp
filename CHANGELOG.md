## [0.8.0] — 2026-04-28

### Added
- **PollingObserver fallback for network filesystem vaults.** The native watchdog `Observer` relies on OS-level filesystem events (`inotify` on Linux, `ReadDirectoryChangesW` on Windows) that don't fire for writes made by remote clients on NFS/SMB network mounts, so new/changed notes were silently missed. Added a `PollingObserver` fallback controlled by `VAULT_WATCH_POLLING` (auto/true/false, default: auto) and `VAULT_POLL_INTERVAL` (seconds, default: 10). Auto-detection uses UNC path detection, `GetDriveTypeW` → `net use` → `wmic` on Windows, and `/proc/mounts` fstype check on Linux. Contributed by @yjjoeathome-byte in #14.

### Fixed
- `osm init` wrote the OpenCode MCP config entry to `~/.opencode.json` (standard MCP format), but OpenCode v1.14+ reads from `~/.config/opencode/opencode.json` using its own native format (`mcp` key, `command` as a flat array, `type: "local"`, `enabled: true`). Fixed `_opencode_cfg_path()` to target the correct path, `update_opencode_config()` to convert the standard entry to OpenCode's native format, and `remove_opencode_config()` / `osm status` to read from the `mcp` key instead of `mcpServers`. OpenCode now correctly sees `obsidian-semantic` as connected.

## [0.7.1] — 2026-04-20

### Fixed
- `osm update` was a silent no-op for the default install. The command previously ran only `docker compose pull mcp-server dashboard`, but those two services use `build: .` in `docker-compose.yml` — `pull` does nothing for build-based services, so no local code was ever refreshed. Fixed by running `compose pull postgres ollama` (refreshes image-based services) followed by `compose build --pull mcp-server dashboard` (pulls the latest base image and rebuilds the two custom services from the current source tree), then `compose up -d mcp-server dashboard`. Covers both the default source-build install and a hypothetical image-based install without branching logic.

## [0.7.0] — 2026-04-20

### Added
- **OpenCode support.** `osm init` now writes the obsidian-semantic MCP entry into `~/.opencode.json` (cross-platform) alongside Claude Desktop and the Claude Code CLI. `osm status` reports OpenCode registration; `osm remove` cleans it up. New helper `register_with_clients()` fans out to every supported MCP client in one call, so adding a fourth (Continue / Cursor / Codex CLI) is a one-line change.

### Changed
- `_docker_entry()` now resolves the actual `mcp-server` container name via `docker compose ps` instead of guessing `<dir>-mcp-server-1`. The generated MCP client entries stay correct when users set `COMPOSE_PROJECT_NAME`, run `docker compose -p custom`, or cloned the repo into a renamed directory. Falls back to the previous behavior if docker is unreachable.

## [0.6.0] — 2026-04-20

### Added
- `osm version` — print installed CLI version and check the latest GitHub release tag, with a one-line hint when a newer release is available.
- `osm update` — pull the latest `mcp-server` and `dashboard` Docker images and restart only those services (matches `osm rebuild`'s scope so non-full-docker installs aren't disturbed). Reports CLI drift and prints the reinstall one-liner when the CLI itself is behind.

### Changed
- Consolidated the `celstnblacc/obsidian-semantic-mcp` repo identifier into a single `_GITHUB_REPO` constant; `_INSTALL_URL` and the generated launcher scripts now derive from it.

## [0.5.13] — 2026-04-20

### Changed
- `index_vault` now batches embeddings via Ollama's `/api/embed` endpoint (Ollama 0.4+) — `EMBED_BATCH_SIZE` items (default 16) per HTTP call instead of one request per note. Eliminates ~14 of every 15 round-trips during a full rebuild and dramatically reduces the surface area for Ollama timeouts under load.
- On batch failure (older Ollama, network blip, or empty embedding for an item), each chunk transparently falls back to per-item `embed()` so no notes are silently dropped.

### Added
- `EMBED_BATCH_SIZE` env var (default 16) to tune the per-call batch size.
- `prune_orphans()` deletes DB rows whose `path` no longer exists on disk — fixes the slow drift between `indexed_count` and `vault_file_count` that builds up after files are deleted, vault paths change, or `OBSIDIAN_IGNORE_PATHS` is updated. Exposed as `POST /api/prune` on the dashboard.

## [0.5.12] — 2026-04-19

### Added
- `--vault-fs <auto|local|nfs|cifs>` flag for `osm init`. With `nfs` / `cifs`, the generated `docker-compose.override.yml` backs each vault with a Docker named volume using NFS or CIFS driver_opts instead of a bind mount — the path that finally works for Windows + NAS setups where bind-mounts of network drives silently mount empty directories.
- `--vault-cifs-user` / `--vault-cifs-pass` flags for SMB credentials.
- `osm remove` now drops `obsidian_vault_*` named volumes referenced by the generated override, so a teardown after `--vault-fs=nfs|cifs` doesn't leak Docker volume references that re-attach on next install.
- README "Alternative: native NFS / CIFS named volumes" section documenting the new flag, syntax, and v1 limitations (no Kerberos, no credential files).

## [0.5.11] — 2026-04-19

### Fixed
- `osm init` now surfaces `docker compose ps -a` and per-container logs immediately when `docker compose up` exits non-zero, instead of letting the postgres health check time out 90 s later. On Windows, a UNC / drive-letter bind-mount failure now points the user at the WSL2 workaround.

### Added
- README "Windows + network vault" section covering the WSL2 mount recipe for NFS / SMB vaults.

## [0.5.10] — 2026-04-19

### Fixed
- `index_vault` now retries failed embeds once and surfaces persistent failures via `get_last_rebuild_failures()`, exposed as `last_rebuild_failed_count` / `last_rebuild_failed_sample` in `/api/stats` — prevents silent data loss when Ollama wedges mid-rebuild

## [0.5.9] — 2026-04-17

### Fixed
- `osm status` now probes Ollama embeddings in addition to daemon reachability, so it reports the "daemon is up but inference is broken" failure mode directly

### Changed
- `docs/RUNBOOK.md` and `README.md` now document the Ollama inference probe and the macOS/Homebrew recovery path: `brew services restart ollama`

## [0.5.8] — 2026-04-15

### Changed
- Add `nul` to `.gitignore` to prevent accidental Windows/Git-Bash redirection artifact from being tracked

---

## [0.5.7] — 2026-04-15

### Changed
- Clarify `osm` CLI terminology in `CLAUDE.md` and `AGENTS.md` to avoid confusion with OpenStreetMap
- Expand `README.md` with full `osm` command reference and flag documentation
- Add `CONTRIBUTING.md` guidelines

---

## [0.5.6] — 2026-04-14

### Changed
- Installer wizard and help banner now display the release version so users can verify the tagged build they are running

---

## [0.5.5] — 2026-04-14

### Added
- `osm dashboard` command — opens the monitoring dashboard (http://localhost:8484) in the default browser; warns if the stack is not running
- `osm init` now offers to install Docker Desktop automatically when missing (`brew` on macOS, `winget` on Windows, `get.docker.com` on Linux)
- `osm init` offers to start Docker Desktop when the daemon is not running and waits for it to become ready
- `[build-system]` added to `pyproject.toml` so `uv` registers the `osm` console script entry point

### Fixed
- Unicode output (box-drawing, checkmarks) no longer crashes on Windows cp1252 consoles — stdout/stderr are wrapped with UTF-8 encoding

### Changed
- Docker Hub CI workflow now runs tests before publishing and builds multi-arch images (amd64 + arm64)
- Tests workflow is now callable as a reusable workflow

---

## [0.5.4] — 2026-04-13

### Fixed
- `osm_init.py` Windows launcher parity: `_link_osm_to_path()` now writes `osm.cmd` (batch wrapper → `scripts\osm.ps1`) on Windows and a bash script on macOS/Linux; `_osm_launcher_path()` returns the platform-correct path; `cmd_remove()` deletes the right file on every platform
- Dashboard `_get_vault_stats()` now uses `_should_skip_path()` instead of a hand-rolled dotfile filter, so `archive/` and `OBSIDIAN_IGNORE_PATHS` are respected; counts now span all `VAULT_PATHS` in multi-vault mode
- Dashboard `_get_db_stats()` recent-notes paths are now relativized against the correct vault root in multi-vault mode
- `test_e2e.py` harness now validates `DATABASE_URL` or `POSTGRES_PASSWORD` is present before spawning the server subprocess, with a clear actionable error if missing
- CI `shipguard` scanner pinned as a dev dependency in `pyproject.toml` (managed via `uv.lock`) and removed from the workflow install step

### Changed
- `src/dashboard.py` imports `_should_skip_path` from `server` — vault stats and indexer now share a single exclusion code path
- `tests/test_unit.py` extended with 21 new tests covering launcher platform parity, dashboard archive exclusion, multi-vault stat counting, multi-vault recent-note relativization, E2E harness env validation, and CI pinning governance
- README native test commands updated to include the required `DATABASE_URL` env var
- README test count and osm Windows launcher description updated
- `docs/RUNBOOK.md` Install/Repair section now documents the platform-specific launcher shape (`osm` bash script vs `osm.cmd` batch wrapper)
- `docs/ARCHITECTURE.md` dashboard extension note updated to reflect that stats span all configured vaults via the shared skip filter

---

## [0.5.3] — 2026-04-06

### Added
- `OBSIDIAN_IGNORE_PATHS` support for vault-relative exclusion segments, with `archive` excluded by default and opt-in override support for archived notes

### Changed
- `src/server.py` now skips `archive/` content during indexing and watcher handling by default
- `README.md` and `docs/RUNBOOK.md` now document the archive exclusion behavior and override

### Fixed
- `osm_init.py` now resolves the osm launcher path through a helper so `cmd_remove()` is testable without touching the real home directory
- `tests/test_osm_commands.py` now redirects launcher deletion to a temp path during tests

---

## [0.5.1] — 2026-03-22

### Added
- `scripts/osm.ps1` — PowerShell CLI wrapper for Windows users

### Changed
- README updated to document both `scripts/osm` (macOS/Linux) and `scripts/osm.ps1` (Windows) wrappers

---

## [0.5.0] — 2026-03-22

### Added
- Multi-vault support in setup wizard — collect multiple vault paths interactively
- `docker-compose.override.yml` auto-generated for multi-vault Docker volume mounts
- `OBSIDIAN_VAULTS` env var written to `.env` when multiple vaults selected

---

## [0.4.0] — 2026-03-22

### Added
- Windows support in setup wizard — Docker-only modes with WSL2 backend detection
- Claude Desktop config path detection for Windows (`%APPDATA%\Claude\`)
- Windows uv installer in README Quick Start section
- `Dockerfile.dashboard` — dedicated Docker image for the dashboard (enables Docker Hub publish)
- ShipGuard SAST scan step in GitHub Actions CI pipeline
- `docs/RUNBOOK.md` — operational runbook for incident response, recovery, and monitoring

### Changed
- Dockerfile runs as non-root `appuser` (was root)
- `.dockerignore` expanded with IDE dirs, `.claude/`, `.superharness/`, secret file patterns
- `.gitignore` now excludes `.claude/` and `.superharness/` session directories

### Fixed
- README Quick Start now shows platform-specific uv install commands (macOS/Linux + Windows)

---

## [0.3.4] — 2026-03-20

### Changed
- Vault volume mounts no longer forced read-only (`:ro` removed) — enables write-back features

### Fixed
- README multi-vault example now matches docker-compose.yml (removed stale `:ro` flags)

---

## [0.3.3] — 2026-03-18

### Fixed
- Dashboard JS completely broken by bare `\n` in Python triple-quoted string (`s.db_error.split('\n')`) — caused silent JS parse failure on every page load (regression in 0.3.2)
- Dashboard stats stuck on `—` / "Fetching…" forever when PostgreSQL is unreachable — DB connection pool now has `connect_timeout=5`
- Dashboard fetch hangs indefinitely when services are down — `AbortController` timeout (15s) added; footer now shows `"Service unreachable — run: osm status"`
- `osm init` wizard loops forever on invalid input — typing `q`, `quit`, `exit`, or `skip` now exits cleanly; prompt hints show `(q to quit)`

### Added
- Status indicator dots now start grey on page load (visible before first fetch completes)
- `tests/test_dashboard_smoke.py` — offline JS/DOM static analysis + live HTTP smoke tests for the dashboard

---

## [0.3.2] — 2026-03-18

### Fixed
- Dashboard: PostgreSQL status now shows the actual error message (e.g. "authentication failed") instead of just "DOWN"

---

## [0.3.1] — 2026-03-18

### Fixed
- `osm init` no longer shows a false warning when `obsidian-semantic` MCP server is already registered — re-running from any project is now fully idempotent
- Claude Desktop config skips update if `obsidian-semantic` already present

### Changed
- `obsidian-semantic` is treated as a single global server shared across all projects — re-running `osm init` detects existing registration and informs the user instead of failing

---

## [0.3.0] — 2026-03-15

### Added
- LRU search cache (256-entry, 10-min TTL) — repeated queries skip Ollama entirely
- `min_similarity` parameter on `search_vault` — filter low-relevance results
- Embedding retry with exponential backoff (3 attempts, 1s → 2s)
- Configurable `EMBED_TIMEOUT` env var (default 15s)
- Structured search logging: query hash, result count, duration_ms
- IVFFlat `lists` auto-tuned from vault size (10–500 range)
- Search testing UI panel in dashboard — test queries without leaving the browser
- `/api/search` endpoint with `min_similarity` support
- Orphaned embeddings count in dashboard stats
- Ollama health check: 5s timeout, 10s result cache
- SSH tunnel connectivity test before launching tunnel (mode 4/3)
- Vault health check during `osm init` — warns if path has no `.md` files
- Ollama model verification after pull
- Docker pull progress streamed in real-time during setup
- `CONTRIBUTING.md` — dev setup, code style, commit conventions, PR checklist
- `ARCHITECTURE.md` — component map, design decisions, DB schema, data flows
- GitHub issue templates (bug report, feature request)
- CI workflow: run unit tests on push/PR (`.github/workflows/tests.yml`)
- CI workflow: publish Docker images on version tags (`.github/workflows/docker-hub.yml`)

### Changed
- Ollama and PostgreSQL ports restricted to `127.0.0.1` (localhost only)
- Resource limits added to all containers (postgres: 1GB, ollama: 4GB, server: 512MB, dashboard: 256MB)
- Log rotation enabled: 100MB max, 3 files per service
- Dashboard port configurable via `DASHBOARD_PORT` env var
- Internal bridge network (`obsidian-internal`) isolates container traffic
- All dependencies pinned to exact versions
- Python minimum bumped to 3.11
- `_get_db_stats` uses `db_conn()` pool (was calling `psycopg2.connect()` directly)
- Type hints added throughout `server.py` and `dashboard.py`

### Fixed
- Vault validation warns without blocking in `--vault`, `$OBSIDIAN_VAULT`, and interactive paths

---

## [0.2.0] — 2026-03-14

### Added
- 183 unit tests covering server, osm CLI wizard, and all user-facing decision paths
- `tests/test_osm_commands.py` — 129 tests for every osm command and install mode
- `tests/conftest.py` — shared `_reset()` helper extracted from both test suites
- Non-interactive `osm init` flags (`--mode`, `--vault`, `--pg-password`, `--persistent`, etc.) for script/agent use
- `--dry-run` flag — preview all actions without making any changes
- `osm remove` command — stop services, wipe volumes and config
- README "Using with Claude" section — example prompts and osm CLI command reference

### Fixed
- README test count updated to reflect current suite (183 tests)
- README Quick Start now mentions `--dry-run` tip
- Path containment check uses `Path.is_relative_to()` instead of `str.startswith()`
- LIMIT clamping assertion checks parameterized query tuple, not SQL string

---

## [0.1.0] — 2026-01-01

### Added
- Initial release
- Semantic search MCP server for Obsidian vaults (pgvector + Ollama)
- PostgreSQL connection pool (`ThreadedConnectionPool(1,5)`)
- Vault file watcher with debounce (watchdog)
- Full CRUD MCP tools: `search_vault`, `simple_search`, `list_files`, `get_file`, `get_files_batch`, `append_content`, `write_file`, `recent_changes`, `list_indexed_notes`, `reindex_vault`
- Monitoring dashboard at `http://localhost:8484`
- Docker Compose full-stack setup (postgres, ollama, mcp-server, dashboard)
- `osm init` interactive wizard — macOS modes 1–4, Linux modes 1–3
- SSH tunnel support for remote Ollama hosts (mode 4)
- sshfs vault mounting for remote vaults
- Persistent bind-mount volumes option (`--persistent`, `--data-dir`)
- Graceful shutdown handling
- Apache 2.0 license
- 2026-04-29: Add wikilink graph augmentation (Path A) — note_links table, extract_wikilinks, expand_via_links, graph_expand param on search_vault, get_note_connections tool
- 2026-04-29: Bump version to 0.9.0 (feat: wikilink graph augmentation)

- 2026-04-30: docs: add Example Output section and bootstrap installer warning to README

## [0.9.1] — 2026-04-30
### Changed
- docs: added Example Output section to README with ranked search results
- docs: bootstrap installer warns about uncommitted-changes failure at ~/.local/share/obsidian-semantic-mcp

## [0.9.2] — 2026-05-04
### Fixed
- `osm init` MCP client entries now route through `scripts/obsidian-semantic-mcp`, a runtime-agnostic wrapper that auto-detects a running `mcp-server` Docker container and falls back to the local `.venv` Python. Replaces the inline `docker compose exec` and `.venv/bin/python3` invocations that broke on container restarts and venv path changes. See `docs/mcp_startup_incident_2026-04-30.md` for context.
- Pin `.python-version` to `3.11.6` (was `3.14`, which was unintended and unavailable on the install host).

## [0.9.3] — 2026-05-04
### Fixed
- MCP server auto-loads `.env` on startup (searches `~/.local/share/obsidian-semantic-mcp/.env` then repo root, with `override=False` so shell env wins). Fixes startup when spawned by an MCP client (OpenCode, Claude Desktop) that doesn't inherit shell env vars.
- Imports inside `src/server.py` and `src/dashboard.py` try relative form first (`from .config import build_dsn`) and fall back to absolute, so the package works both when installed via `uv tool install` and when run directly from `src/` during development.

### Added
- `obsidian-semantic-mcp` console script entry point (`src.server:run_server`) for global `uv tool install`.

## [0.9.4] — 2026-05-06
### Fixed
- MCP wrapper script now waits up to 30 seconds (configurable via `OSM_DOCKER_WAIT`) for the `mcp-server` Docker container to enter the running state before falling back to the local venv. Eliminates the startup race where Claude Code spawns the wrapper while Docker is still warming up the container, the wrapper sees no running container, falls through to a not-yet-ready local fallback, and the MCP gets marked failed for the entire session. Adds a `docker info` short-circuit so the wait is skipped when the daemon is intentionally off. See `docs/mcp_startup_race_2026-05-06.md` for the full analysis.
- 2026-05-06: v0.9.5 — Python launcher entry point (path-agnostic, OSM_DOCKER=1 opt-in); docker-compose.yml switches from local build to Docker Hub images (OSM_VERSION pin)

## [0.9.6] — 2026-05-06
### Added
- Project root discovery via ~/.config/obsidian-semantic-mcp/project_root (written by osm init).
- Launcher now automatically enables Docker mode if the project root is discovered and OSM_DOCKER is not "0".
- Launcher now automatically loads .env from the project root.
### Fixed
- MCP stdio transport: replaced `mcp.server.stdio.stdio_server` with raw `sys.stdin.buffer` feeding anyio memory streams. Fixes "-32000: Connection closed" when the MCP client reconnects between sessions (anyio.wrap_file EOF bug).
### Changed
- MCP client configurations are now zero-config (empty env block, path-agnostic obsidian-semantic-mcp command).
- 2026-05-07: pi agent support — osm init now registers obsidian-semantic in ~/.pi/agent/mcp.json (heartbeat: true) and patches mcp-bridge.ts to start heartbeat at spawn time, fixing permanent deadlock on initialize
- 2026-05-08: fix(transport): stdin reader uses anyio.to_thread.run_sync for sys.stdin.buffer.readline — prevents event-loop freeze that caused 30s initialize timeout when MCP client (Claude Code) spawns over anonymous pipes with stdin held open. Preserves the May 7 raw-stdin transport's no-EOF-death property by treating empty readline as idle-retry, not exit. (v0.10.1)
- 2026-05-08: detect MCP-host Stop-hook kill regressions — log clear diagnostic on SIGTERM/SIGHUP within 60s of startup (points at `verify-mcp-stop-hook` and the Stop hook entry in $HOME/.claude/settings.json)
- 2026-05-08: chore: bump version to 0.10.2 (patch — external-kill diagnostic for Stop-hook regression detection)
- 2026-05-08: feat!(init): drop KEYLOGGER_MCP coupling. Remove `_with_keylogger` helper and `_KEYLOGGER_ENABLED` env-var read from osm_init.py. `_docker_entry` and `_native_entry` now return `{"command": "obsidian-semantic-mcp", "args": [], "env": {}}` directly. Tests updated. Migration: install keylogger-mcp v0.2.0+ and run `keylogger-mcp wrap claude-code obsidian-semantic` per host. Aligns with tilth v0.7.0 and token-diet v1.9.0. Bumps 0.10.2 → 0.11.0.
- 2026-05-21: fix: persist COMPOSE_PROFILES=full-docker to .env (full-docker installs) so the Ollama embeddings container survives a bare `docker compose up -d`; mcp-server healthcheck now pings Ollama (fails loud instead of green-but-search-dead); register_pi_agent mkdirs its config dir before writing. (v0.11.1)
- 2026-05-21: ci: move `:latest` on every release tag (was gated to a never-true is_default_branch condition); add PyPI Trusted Publishing workflow (publish-pypi.yml).
- 2026-05-21: feat: repo-independent install. PROJECT_ROOT resolves config-first (OSM_PROJECT_ROOT, then ~/.config/.../project_root, then co-located compose, then $XDG_DATA_HOME/obsidian-semantic-mcp) instead of __file__; the wheel now force-includes osm_init.py, obsidian_semantic_mcp.py and docker-compose.yml; osm init provisions the compose stack into the deploy dir when not co-located. pip/uv-tool installs are now self-contained and decoupled from the source checkout. (v0.12.0)
- 2026-05-21: fix: drop the `./src/server.py` bind mount from docker-compose.yml. The published image already carries the anyio transport patch, so the dev-only override was vestigial; removing it lets a pip-provisioned deploy dir run without co-located src/, and keeps pinned deploys version-consistent. (v0.12.0)
- 2026-05-21: fix(build): the Dockerfile copied the force-included files (osm_init.py, obsidian_semantic_mcp.py, docker-compose.yml) after `uv sync --no-editable`, so the wheel build failed and v0.12.0 published no Docker image. Copy them before uv sync. Also make publish-pypi.yml manual-only (workflow_dispatch) until a PyPI Trusted Publisher is registered, so release tags do not trigger a failing publish job. (v0.12.1)
- 2026-05-21: fix(build): apply the same force-include copy-order fix to Dockerfile.dashboard. v0.12.1 fixed only the main Dockerfile, so the dashboard image build still failed with `Forced include not found: /app/docker-compose.yml`. Both images now build (verified locally for server + dashboard). (v0.12.2)

- 2026-06-25: chore: remove personal workspace path from tracked files
- 2026-06-25: chore: remove personal workspace path from tracked files
- 2026-07-06: feat: write_file now auto-injects mandatory frontmatter (aliases, tags, category, session, nas-path, related + created/updated) via _ensure_frontmatter; created is set once and never overwritten, updated always reflects the write, existing caller values and extra keys are preserved. Adds pyyaml dependency. (v0.13.0)
- 2026-07-06: fix(tests): test_all_services_healthy now skips (not fails) when Ollama/Postgres are unreachable due to a connection-level failure (DNS resolution, connection refused, timeout) rather than a real application-level error — added _is_unreachable_error() classifier + 5 offline unit tests (TestUnreachableErrorClassification). Root cause of the prior failure: the dashboard backend's OLLAMA_URL pointed at a Docker-Compose-internal hostname (`ollama`) that only resolves inside that network, so any pytest run outside it always saw a NameResolutionError — an environment mismatch, not a code regression. This was the one previously-failing test that required --no-verify on the mandatory-frontmatter commit; full suite is now 315 passed, 1 skipped, 0 failed with no hook bypass needed. (v0.13.1)
- 2026-07-09: feat: add `osm vaults` command — lists the configured Obsidian vault(s) from `.env` (`OBSIDIAN_VAULTS` or `OBSIDIAN_VAULT`), flagging any path that no longer exists. (v0.14.0)
